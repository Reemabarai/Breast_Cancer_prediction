Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts whether a patient is likely to have Breast Cancer (Malignant or Benign) using Machine Learning algorithms. The model helps in early detection of breast cancer using diagnostic data, which can support doctors in making faster and more accurate decisions.

ðŸš€ Features

-Data cleaning and preprocessing -Feature selection and visualization -Model training using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest -Comparison of both modelsâ€™ performance -Achieved 98% accuracy with SVM and 96% with Random Forest

ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

-Support Vector Machine (SVM) â€“ achieved 98% accuracy -Random Forest Classifier â€“ achieved 96% accuracy -Both algorithms were trained on the same dataset and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

Dataset Used: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset â€“ UCI Machine Learning Repository

The dataset consists of 30 features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. Each feature represents characteristics like radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, etc., along with a diagnosis label:

M = Malignant (cancerous) B = Benign (non-cancerous)

ðŸ§° Technologies and Tools Used

-Python -Scikit-learn -Pandas -NumPy -Matplotlib -Seaborn -Jupyter Notebook

Conclusion: The SVM model performed slightly better, achieving 98% accuracy, making it more effective for this classification task.
